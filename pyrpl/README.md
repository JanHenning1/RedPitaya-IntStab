PyRPL
===================
[PyRPL](https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl) example files. 

Load the example configuration file *example_intstab.yml* via PyRPL after you have set your Red Pitaya's IP ('host:') and password ('password:') in the file. A two channel intensity stabilization is realized with the PyRPL 'pids' module. If you want to use the sample and hold feature, install the PyRPL branch ['external pid pause'](https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/tree/external_pid_pause).

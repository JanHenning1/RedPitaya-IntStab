PyRPL
===================
Use the RedPitaya with the open source software [PyRPL](https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl).

Installation
--------------------
For windows OS, create  an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment from  `pyrpl-env.yaml` and install PyRpl `0.9.3.6` or the branch `external_pid_pause`.  


Examples
--------------------

Load the example configuration file  `example_intstab.yml` via PyRPL after you have set your Red Pitaya's IP ('host:') and password ('password:') in the file. A two channel intensity stabilization is realized with the PyRPL 'pids' module. If you want to use the sample and hold feature, install the PyRPL branch ['external pid pause'](https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/tree/external_pid_pause).
